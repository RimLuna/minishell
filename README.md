I don't even know how to use bash properly

nevermind fucking make one
## What the fuck
This project either sounds overly complicated or overly simple, it's a whole lot of text interpretation, AGAIN

**Take-away: parsing 'till I fucking drop dead, in a bad way**
## bash grammar
### literal values
```
mkdir traitors
mkdir class traitors
mkdir "fucking liberals"
```
bash interprets **"fucking liberals"**,  **traitors**, and **class traitors** (the space too) as literal values.

while **mkdir**, **spaces between mkdir and the literals**, and **quotation marks** are not

*this already sounds like a fucking pain in the ass*
### quotes: just using them is a nightmare
#### double quotes
well there's the fucking nightmare of expanding *special characters* (**$** for example) because double quotes are whores

where **$var** is replaced by the value of variable var
#### single quotes
the entire text strinf is interpreted literally, yay
#### FUCKING spaces, I am regretting ever writing code
Starting with filenames, why would you put a space in a filename, why why why, fucking idiots, as a *stalinist*, I'd 've not allowed this, along with **80s graphics projects**
```
$ mkdir "eat the rich"
$ mkdir "I put my low
> self esteem 
> into filenames"
$ ls
'eat the rich'
'I put my low'$'\n''self esteem '$'\n''into filenames'
```
I don't know if we're supposed to interpret newlines in filenames because that's fucking stupid and a hate crime.
